## Introduction

The Image Encryption with Dual Encryption project aims to offer a user-friendly tool for securing images through a combination of two encryption techniques: Rubik's cube-based encryption and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. By leveraging both encryption methods, the application provides enhanced security for sensitive image files.

## Features

- Encrypt images using Rubik's cube-based encryption
- Encrypt images using AES encryption
- Decrypt images encrypted with both encryption methods
- Simple and intuitive GUI interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Tkinter
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy
- pycryptodome

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tkinter pillow numpy pycryptodome
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JyothishRK/Dual-Key-Image-Encryption.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Dual-Key-Image-Encryption
```

### Running the Application

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
python3 Source_Code.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the Rubik's key and AES key in the provided fields.
3. Click on the "Encrypt" button to encrypt an image using both encryption algorithms.
4. Click on the "Decrypt" button to decrypt an encrypted image.
